# MobileVR
An offshoot of the original VRViewFinder. This version uses ARCore on Android devices to synchronize the position of the VRViewFinder instead of VRTrackers such as the original MOVIS project (https://github.com/echo-lab/MOVIS).
As a result, many restrictions have been lifted, such as the order of what device joins when, trackers, tracker numbers, etc.

### To Do
- Sychronize the position of the devices with respect to eachother
- Have a consistent world origin
- Add support for a "Master User"
